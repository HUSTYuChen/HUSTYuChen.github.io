<img src="https://cy1034429432.github.io/cy1034429543.github.io/yuchenbig.jpg" class="floatpic" width="530" height="450">

Here is **Yu Chen ([陈宇](https://caihanlin.com/file/蔡汉霖简历.pdf))**.

I am currently pursuing a master’s degree with the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, advised by [Prof. Bin Qin](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/qinbin/zh_CN/index/1375399/list/index.htm) and [Prof. Xu Liu](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/liuxuSEEE/zh_CN/index.htm).  I received my B.S. degree from the College of Engineering and Technology, Southwest University, Chongqing, China, in 2022, advised by [Prof. Zhongyong Zhao](http://gcjsxy.swu.edu.cn/info/1013/1634.htm). Here is [my Resume](https://caihanlin.com/file/Resume-HanlinCAI.pdf).

## Research Interests

- Modeling beam transport systems, beam tuning (Current work)
- The application of artificial intelligence in electrical engineering (Always)
- Condition monitoring, fault diagnosing for power equipment, electrical equipment modeling (while I am an undergraduate student)

My current research focuses on practical problems about beam transport that artificial intelligence faces in real life. My interests are in **artificial intelligence** (data augmentation, anomaly detection, life long learning, reinforcement learning, few-shot learning, etc.) and its applications in **electrical engineering** (fault diagnosis, system identification, optimize control, etc.). In a word, advanced technologies like ML influence the life of everybody.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
