# About Me

<img src="https://hustyuchen.github.io/yuchenbig.jpg" class="floatpic" width="3200" height="2400">

Here is **Yu Chen ([é™ˆå®‡](https://hustyuchen.github.io/file/CV_YuChen.pdf))**.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Building Environment and Energy Engineering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, under the supervision of [Prof. Yaping Du](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/beee/people/academic-staff/professor-du-yaping/) and [Research Assistant Prof. Yuxuan Ding](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/beee/people/academic-staff/dr-ding-yuxuan/). Before this, I obtained a B.S. degree from the College of Engineering and Technology at Southwest University and an M.S. degree from the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, where I was advised by [Prof. Zhongyong Zhao](http://gcjsxy.swu.edu.cn/info/1013/1634.htm) and [Prof. Bin Qin](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/qinbin/zh_CN/index/1375399/list/index.htm), respectively. Here is [my Resume](https://hustyuchen.github.io/file/CV_YuChen.pdf) (Last updated: May 2025).

I would love to chat and collaborate if you are interested in any aspect of me and my work. Please email me at  yu_chen2000@hust.edu.cn or chen1034429543 (WeChat).

## Research Interests

- Transient model and fault diagnosis for transformer winding based on frequency response analysis (Ph.D., these research works are a continuation of my undergraduate work ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š.)
- Start-to-end modeling and surrogate model for a proton therapy facility and intelligent beamline optimization (M.S., I am no longer engaged in related research ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.)
- Broadband equivalent circuit modeling, condition monitoring, and fault diagnosing for synchronous machine winding based on frequency response analysis (B.S., I am still conducting relevant research at present ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š.)

My current research focuses on transformer winding modeling and fault diagnosis. My interests are in **artificial intelligence** (data augmentation, anomaly detection, lifelong learning, reinforcement learning, few-shot learning, etc.) and its applications in **electrical engineering** (fault diagnosis, system identification, optimal control, etc.). In a word, advanced technologies like ML influence the lives of everybody and help us to do objective decision.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
